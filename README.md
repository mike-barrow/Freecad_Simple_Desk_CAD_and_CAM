Bench Dimensions: 54"x30" top, 30.5" height

- You can modify the dimensions of the bench by editing the spreadsheet in ```Parameters.FCStd```
- Don't forget to recompute the models in each for the ```.FCStd``` files to ensure changes are propagated.
- The CAM folder is de-coupled from paramaterization, as is the gcode

## Prerequisites
